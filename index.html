    <h1>the learn enough story</h1>
    
    <p>
      learn enough to be dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. this includes
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      we believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can 
      benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. to join our
      movement, <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official

      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">tim
      berners-lee</a>. it's not true that sir tim invented HTML in order to
      share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

      learn enough to be dangerous was founded in 2015 by michael hartl, lee
      donahoe, and nick merwin. we believe that the kind of technical
      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
      <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

      when he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related learn enough tutorials.

      you may have seen him shredding guitar live with capital cities on jimmy
      kimmel, conan, or the ellen show, but rest assured nick is a true nerd
      at heart. he's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
